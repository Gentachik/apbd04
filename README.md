# refactoring-example
In this task, your task is to modify the code of an application called LegacyApp. We assume that this is a degrading application and we want to improve the quality of its code. We want the code in the "LegacyAppConsumer" project to remain unchanged. In other words, we cannot modify the code in this project. Everything in the LegacyApp project can be modified - as long as it does not change the interface of the classes used in the LegacyAppConsumer project. Additionally, the UserDataAccess class and the AddUser static method cannot be modified. We assume that for some reason we cannot modify this class.
